##  Concepts Applied

* File I/O using CSV
* Object-oriented design
* Use of STL containers (`map`, `queue`, etc.)
* Manual memory management (linked lists, binary trees)
* Console UI with cursor positioning (Windows API)

---

##  Limitations

* Platform-dependent: Works only on **Windows** due to use of Windows-specific functions.
* No GUI or database yet (CSV-based for simplicity).

---

##  Future Improvements

* Cross-platform support (remove Windows API dependencies)
* GUI using Qt or similar
* Integration with online movie APIs (e.g., TMDb)
* Login encryption / password hashing
* Unit testing
